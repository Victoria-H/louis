Challenging experiences
=======================
The Masters Program at ESCEM demands high standards, and entry to the Audit Specialisation was very competitive, and demanded strong academic results and organisational skills to achieve the good results I obtained in the entrance exams. 

Throughout my studies we were presented with challenging team projects, developing my collaboration and leadership skills and my ability to work to tight deadlines and present results effectively.

My last internship was challenging as I had to acquire a large number of new skills in a short period and meet both the customers' and my manager's expectations. I was pleased that I was able to do this and learnt a lot from this experience.   

Taking on volunteering activities (student union, volunteer accountant) in parallel with my studies meant that I had to manage my time and set priorities very carefully. I enjoyed contributing to the extra-curricula activities of the school, particularly performing with my group at the school concerts.
